/**
 * A PTree contains the counts of each character after a certain amount of characters that come before it.
 * This is found by ingesting large amounts of strings into the class using addStr().
 *
 * Further Explanation:
 * This class is used to count the occurances of certain strings of characters.
 * This is done by creating a tree where one character leads to another, and each
 * node in the tree has a specific count associated with it.
 * For example, if you were to call addStr() on both park and pays, the tree would be as follows:
 *
 * p(2) --> a(2) --> r(1) --> k(1)
 *          |
 *          +-- y(1) --> s(1)
 *
 * This structure is similar to a trie.
 *
 * Parallelization:
 * The class is not designed to be operated on in parallel, however this can be accomplished with
 * processing sub-trees and then merging the gathered data with mergeTree().
 * i.e. : You have 1000 strings. In one thread you create a PTree and process 500. 
 *        In another you process the other 500. Then, you merge one into the other (or a main PTree).
